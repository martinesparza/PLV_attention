### **Statement:**

Taken from Esparza-Iaizzo et al,. 2022, with permission. Cognitive neuroscience advances should ideally have a real-world impact, with an obvious avenue for transference being BCI applications. The hope is to faithfully translate user-generated brain endogenous states into control signals to actuate devices. A paramount challenge for transfer is to move from group-level, multi-trial average approaches to single-trial level. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of single-trial estimation of phase synchrony across distant brain regions. Although many studies relate attention to long-range synchrony modulation, no current approach to BCI control, to our knowledge, had previously capitalised on these findings. We present a first attempt at synchrony-based BCI that, albeit unsuccessful, should help break new ground to map endogenous attention shifts to real-time control of brain-computer actuated systems via synchrony estimation.
